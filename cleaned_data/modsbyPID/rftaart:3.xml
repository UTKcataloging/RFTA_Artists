   <abstract>Becky Jackson talked about how she had found out about the fire while at work. She left to try and get to her house but the police stopped her. She couldn’t get to her house and she couldn’t get her husband to leave. Finally, she convinced him to leave and just bring her pets. Once he was down the mountain the authorities wouldn’t let him go back. Their house was destroyed by the fire. Pets were mentioned in many interviews. Some people were able to evacuate with their pets. Some people left their pets behind thinking the fire wouldn’t get close or because they were unable to take them along.</abstract>
